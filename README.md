### Points I would improve if given enough time

1. Add more error handling for the API requests.
2. Add styling to the loading indicators while the data is being fetched from the API.
3. Improve mobile responsiveness across all screen sizes
4. Add more unit tests for the other components to ensure they are functioning correctly.
5. Turn the project to a multi-page website using react router
6. I would add more features to the project, such as the ability to sign up for a course, display more detailed course information, and improve the styling and layout of the page to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
